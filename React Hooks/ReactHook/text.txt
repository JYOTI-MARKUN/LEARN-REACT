What is Hooks ?
Ans: Hooks are special functions, that allow us to use state and other React Features in functional component, earlier when we use functional component to create react app we do not have access to state management and lifecycle method, so to access these feactures we had to add class component, so this was the problem with functional component but after introducing React Hooks from version 16.8 we can now use sttae management and other react features without writing class components,hooks are the functions that make functional components work like class components, hooks make react functional components so easy to use
