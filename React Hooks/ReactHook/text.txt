What is Hooks ?
Ans: Hooks are special functions, that allow us to use state and other React Features in functional component, earlier when we use functional component to create react app we do not have access to state management and lifecycle method, so to access these feactures we had to add class component, so this was the problem with functional component but after introducing React Hooks from version 16.8 we can now use sttae management and other react features without writing class components,hooks are the functions that make functional components work like class components, hooks make react functional components so easy to use

Benifites of react Hooks ?
React Hooks simplifies the code, improve the readability, reusabilty and overall performance of the application

# useState Hook 
useState is a react hook that creates an State Variable that helps us to track state Variable and updates the ui when state changes

use state is a react hook that is an array having the initial value and an array to update the value

# useEffect Hook
useEffect hook allows us to perform side effects in our components
Examples of sideEffect are
Fetching data from API
Directly updating the DOM element
Timers like setTimeout and serInterval

for using useEffect Hook we need to pass two value firts one is callback fnction and the second one is an array the second option is optional to pass second option is dependency array which can be empty


# useRef Hook
useRef is a react hook that allows us to create mutuable variables which will not re-render the component,it is also use to access the DOM elements

#usememo Hook
The React useMemo Hook returns a memorized value.(it is like caching a value so that it doesn't need to be recalculated)
the useMemo hook only runs when one of it's dependencies gets updated. This can improve the performance of the application. there is one more hook that improve the performance and that is useCallback Hokk both useCallback and useMemo hooks are similar only difference is, useMemo hook takes two parameters first is callback function and the second is dependencies array
useMemo returs a memorized value
useCallback returns a memorized function

#useCallback
it is react hooks that lets us cache a function definition between re-renders.It means, when we use useCallback hook in react, it does not create the multiple instances of the same function when re-render happens.instead of creating new function it provides the cached function on re-render of the component

#useContext
useContext is a react hook that allows us access data from any component without explicitly passing it down through props at every level, it is used to manage global data in react app
we can use useContext hook in three steps
creating the Context 
providing the Context
comsuming the Context


#useReducer
useReducer hook is similar to useState hook but instead of providing state and setter function it provide state and dispatch function, useReducer hook takes two arguments first one is 
Reducer function
Initial state
ans it retunrs the current state and dispatch method
