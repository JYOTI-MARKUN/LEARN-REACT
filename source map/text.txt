what is source maps
when we innclude cdn link of babel it is not required to add lib folder as we can directly get the source maps file

but when we use babel by script tag then it is become diffucukt for us to debug any code so  we nedd to add --source-maps code in build code of  prackage.json file and install some dev depend file

and when we map script.js.map file then this file will have the code that we have write in our script file 

second way to map source.json.map file with script file in lib is by setting sourcemap=true in .babelrc file

third if we add --watch in place of --source-maps build code of prackage manager then it will wait for future changes also
