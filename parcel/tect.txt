we can import react or any node package directly
our browser do not under stand node_modules, it is only for server

and react do not run on server it is for browser it s client side 

what is parcel and why we need to use parcel 
parcel is a bundler it create a folder dist which have index.html file and this file include javascript file in script tag and these files are created by parcel it is not our files and in the js file we have our whole react code when we import react and reactdom file in our js file then parcel automatically include di folder when we run npx parcel index.html 


in disc folder js file we have a lot code as parcel

hot reloadimg means new code will be updated automatically withour relaod of the browser
