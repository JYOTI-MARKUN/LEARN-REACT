sometime we have a page where our user do not visit frequently, so to load that page in very first attempt is not assume to be a good practice so we split our code and load that page through lazy load, that meand when user visit that page only that time load that page

FOR LAZY LOAD we need to import our page lazyly and for that react provide us a lazy function thta take a callback function where we import 

when we lazy load a function we need to wrap the outlet function into suspense 

// FALL BACK : We can use FALL in suspense as when we load a page through lazy load it takes time to get the content os till the content loaded we want something like loading to show user

// when we export normally not export default

// resolve value of a promise for about component {default:About} for contact {default:Component} in case of default export when there no default export then we get {About:About} for about page
